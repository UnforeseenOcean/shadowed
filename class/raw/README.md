Proto files were generated from decompiled `ShadowrunDTO.dll` sources.

Few minor changes were applied to make the files valid as a whole:
* `TsVariableScope___ZERO` was added to `TsVariableScope` enum to satisfy nullable constraint of some fields
* 4 conflicting `Entry` messages were renamed to `PortraitEntry`, `TotemEntry`, `ManifestEntry` and `ResultEntry`.
